#Ethereum.NET

A .NET implementation of the [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/) protocol; a platform for building decentralised applications.
<br /><br />


##What?
Whilst the internet is an excellent medium for facilitating communication and collaboration; there is a problem with trust. It's just too easy to lie. Our current model mitigates this by relying on centralised authorities to arbitrate between parties. A few limitations with this model include:

- single point of failure
- single point of control
- may be biased/incompetent/corrupt/untrustworthy themselves


Enter Ethereum - a platform for building decentralised applications. It avoids centralised authorities by relying on peer consensus.

##How?
The aim of the project is to build a platform for creating decentralised applications, by providing a [turing complete](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness) language built on top of a generic [blockchain](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Block_chain).
